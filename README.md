# Dev Workflow Automation

A simple .bat script to automate the process of opening Visual Studio Code for both frontend and backend projects and starting the development servers.

## Overview

As a Fullstack Developer and Frontend Team Lead, managing multiple projects and tasks can be time-consuming, especially when it involves repetitive setup tasks. This script aims to streamline the development workflow by automating the following steps:

- Opening VSCode for frontend and backend projects.
- Navigating to the project directories.
- Running the necessary commands to start the development servers.

## How to Use

Clone the repository:

```batch
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dev-workflow-automation.git
```


Navigate to the cloned repository:
```batch
cd dev-workflow-automation
```

Modify the paths and commands in the .bat file as needed:
- Open the .bat file in a text editor and update the following lines with your project paths and commands:
```batch
set FRONTEND_PATH=C:\Your\Frontend\Path
set BACKEND_PATH=C:\Your\Backend\Path
set FRONTEND_CMD=npm start
set BACKEND_CMD=npm run dev
```
Save the .bat file with your modifications.

Run the .bat file:
Double-click the start_projects.bat file to execute the script. This will open VSCode for both frontend and backend projects and start the development servers automatically.

## Benefits
- Saves Time: No more manual opening of VSCode and running commands.
- Increases Productivity: Focus on coding rather than repetitive setup tasks.
- Reduces Errors: Ensures consistent startup processes every time.
